```
Basic Practice
Counter Component
Create a counter component where a button increments the count by 1 each time it is clicked.

Toggle Button
Create a button that toggles between "ON" and "OFF" each time it is clicked.

Input Field Handler
Create a form with a text input. Display the entered text below the input in real-time.

Multiple States
Create a component that uses multiple useState hooks to manage the first name and last name separately. Display the full name below the input fields.

Intermediate Practice
Dynamic Background Color
Create a button that changes the background color of the page randomly every time it is clicked.

List Manager
Build a component that lets users add items to a list by typing in an input field and clicking an "Add" button. Display the updated list below the input.

Form Validation
Create a login form with email and password fields. Display an error message if the email or password is empty when the user submits the form.

Counter with Steps
Create a counter where the user can increment or decrement the count by a step value that they can enter in an input field.

Advanced Practice
Toggle Multiple Items
Create a component that displays a list of items. Clicking on an item toggles its "selected" state (e.g., highlight the selected items).

Dynamic Forms
Create a dynamic form where users can add or remove fields (e.g., a list of email inputs for multiple recipients).

Timer
Build a simple timer component that starts from 0 and increments every second when the user clicks a "Start" button. Add a "Pause" button to stop the timer.

Theme Switcher
Create a light/dark mode toggle using useState to update the theme of the page.

Real-World Scenarios
Shopping Cart
Create a shopping cart where you manage the count of items added to the cart and display the total price dynamically.

Accordion Component
Create an accordion where clicking on a section title expands or collapses its content.

Image Carousel
Create an image carousel where the user can click "Next" and "Previous" buttons to cycle through images.

Tabs Component
Build a tabs component that switches content when different tabs are clicked.

Debugging and Optimization
Previous State Dependency
Create a counter where clicking a button increments the count by 2 using the previous state value.

State Reset
Build a quiz app where clicking a "Reset" button clears all the answers and resets the form to its initial state.

Persisted State
Create a component where the count value persists in localStorage using useState and useEffect.

Complex State Update
Build a multi-step form where the state contains the current step and the form data for each step.
